		<h1>Why learn Ruby on Rails?</h1>
		<p>A list of 7 key points explaining why we decided to teach Ruby on Rails at Le Wagon.</p>

		<p>Since I’ve been the CTO and teacher of the French coding bootcamp Le Wagon, the question “Why learn <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>?” is often asked by many entrepreneurs who are eager to learn to code. That’s why I decided to put together a list of seven key points explaining why we decided to train newbies how to code by teaching them Ruby on Rails.</p>

		<p>Important: Note that Ruby / Ruby on Rails is a good choice to start programming, but not an exclusive choice. Python / Django are also solid options. At Le Wagon we decided to teach Ruby on Rails mainly because of its educational value.</p>

		<h2>Ruby, an easy-to-approach programming language</h2>

		<p>
			One of the first nice things about Ruby on Rails lies in the Ruby language itself. The syntax is simple, concise, close to the English language and very flexible. For experienced developers, Ruby opens the way for meta-programming (the act of writing code in order for your service to generate other pieces of code automatically) uniquely. Intellectually, it’s a pleasure to structure one’s thinking and to write code in this language.
